# Number-Guessing-Game
This code is for a simple number guessing game. The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 50, and the player has 10 chances to guess it. After each guess, the computer gives hints like "Too low!" or "Too high!" to help the player. The game ends when the player guesses the number or runs out of attempts.
